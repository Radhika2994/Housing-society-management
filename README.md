Housing Society Management Website built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and PostgreSQL. Features include user/admin login, notices, payments, complaints, user management, and amenities page — streamlining society operations for transparency and efficiency.
The Housing Society Management Website is a full-stack web application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and PostgreSQL to streamline communication and administration within a housing society. It offers secure user and admin logins, enabling residents to view notices, make or record payments, submit complaints, and check amenities, while admins can post announcements, track payments, manage complaints, and update user accounts. By digitizing manual processes, the system ensures faster communication, accurate record-keeping, and transparency in society operations. The workflow is simple: residents sign up or log in, access their dashboard for updates and services, and any actions—such as payments or complaints—are instantly reflected on the admin side. An amenities page lists all available facilities, keeping residents informed. This project not only solves common housing society issues like delays, lost records, and lack of transparency but also showcases practical full-stack development skills, database integration, and real-world problem-solving ability.
